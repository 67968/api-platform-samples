# Access Entity

This sample shows how to retrieve profiles for entities from the Apigee Edge
datastore. Using this policy, you can retrieve profiles for things like
apps, developers, and API products. Sometimes you need this information 
to enable dynamic behavior in policies or code running on Apigee Edge.

This example shows you how to get a developer's email address based on 
the API key that is presented by the app (that is, the 'invoke.sh' script).

Complete documentation for this policy can found here:
