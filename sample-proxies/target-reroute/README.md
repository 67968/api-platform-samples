### Sample use case

Rewrite a target URL dynamically on Apigee Edge.

### Trace

This screen shot from the [Apigee Edge trace tool](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/content/using-trace-tool-0) shows the placement of the policies used in this sample.

### About

This sample API proxy illustrates how to change the target endpoint URL using a JavaScript policy to set the `target.url` flow variable. This variable holds the complete URL for the back-end target endpoint, including any query parameters.  

1. Deploy the proxy. 
1. Send this request to Apigee Edge. 

    **Note:** The proxy is configured with a base path of `/WOEID`. The incoming request must contain that base path or the request will not be processed. Tip: Take a look at the `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml` to see where this base path is configured.

    `curl http://myorg-test.apigee.net/WOEID/2467861`

2. An [Extract Variables policy](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/reference/extract-variables-policy) extracts the part of the path that comes after the `/WOEID` base path. 

3. The policy stores the value `2467861` in a flow variable called `WOEID.location`. Here is the policy XML:

    ```xml
    <ExtractVariables name="extractId">
        <DisplayName>getWOEIDNumberfromPath</DisplayName>
        <URIPath>
            <Pattern ignoreCase="true">/{location}</Pattern>
        </URIPath>
        <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
        <VariablePrefix>WOEID</VariablePrefix>
    </ExtractVariables>
    ```


4. A [JavaScript policy](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/reference/javascript-policy) rewrites the target URL by setting the `target.url` flow variable. This expression also appends the `WOEID.location` value to the query parameter `w`.

    `context.setVariable("target.url", "http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w="+context.getVariable("WOEID.location"));`

5. Finally, the newly formed target request is sent to the backend target, the Yahoo weather API, and the weather forecast for the specified locale is returned.
