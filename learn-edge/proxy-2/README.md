# Proxy to a target service

We'll modify the first proxy "do-nothing" proxy so that it calls an actual backend target service. This proxy does actual work!

### Try it

Deploy and invoke the proxy. These are the basic steps:

1. `cd api-platform-samples/tutorials/proxy-2`.
2. `./deploy.sh`
3. `./invoke.sh`
4. Compare the output to the `proxy-1` output. 

### View it in the Edge UI

Go to the Edge UI and run a Trace on this API. How does it differ from the Trace you saw in `proxy-1`?

### About what changed

To get our proxy to call a target service, we made a few changes to the simple do-nothing proxy we deployed before. 

* In the `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml` file, we changed the RouteRule element. The `name` attribute isn't that important in this example, but the `<TargetEndpoint>` element is important. That element refers to a TargetEndpoint definition that must exist and have the name "default". 

  **Tip:** It might help if you open these files and look at them in their entirety.

   ```xml
   <RouteRule name="default">
        <!-- This connects our proxy to the target defined in apiproxy/targets/default.xml -->
        <TargetEndpoint>default</TargetEndpoint>
   </RouteRule>
   ```

* We defined the TargetEndpoint in a file called `apiproxy/targets/default.xml`. In that file, we added this XML block, which specifies the target of the proxy, a web service called `mocktarget.apigee.net`.

   ```xml
   <TargetEndpoint name="default">
      <HTTPTargetConnection>
        <!-- This is where we define the target. For this sample we just use a simple URL. -->
        <URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net/</URL>
      </HTTPTargetConnection>
   </TargetEndpoint>
   ```

The name of the TargetEndpoint (default) is important -- it is the name referred to in the RouteRule element in `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml`. 

### What you did

You deployed a modified proxy that calls a backend target -- a web service used for simple testing purposes. 

### Extra reading: important words and concepts

* **Target service** -- A backend service that the proxy calls on behalf of the requesting app. Here, we're going to return data from a service called `mocktarget.apigee.net`. 
* **RouteRule** -- Specifies which target endpoint definition file to call. Route rules can have logic to route calls conditionally to different targets. 
* **TargetEndpoint** -- The name of a target definition in the apiproxy/targets directory. 
* **HTTPTargetConnection** -- Defines the target to which to send the request. Usually a URL. 

### Other things to try

* In a browser, hit http://mocktarget.apigee.net/help to see what else the service can do. 
* Modify the `invoke.sh` script to hit one of the other resources. For example: `curl http://<your org>-test.apigee.net/json`. 

  **Notable Concept**: By default, whatever you add to the base path of the API proxy gets passed on unchanged to the target. 

* Try changing the proxy to call another service. You might have to supply an API key or some other auth parameter -- many public API keys require some kind of auth.  Test the change (redeploy and invoke). Hint: Edit `apiproxy/targets/default.xml`.
