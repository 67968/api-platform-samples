# Python Script Sample

### Sample use case

Execute a Python script in an API flow. 

### Policies 

This sample uses this policy: 

* ![alt text](../../images/icon_policy_python.jpg "Python Script policy") Python Script: To set response headers. The policy is set on the target response flow.
 

### About

This very simple example executes a Python script that adds a response header to the API. The proxy calls an API to get the weather for Palo Alto, CA.

The Python script just sets a response header to the value of a flow variable:

```
response.setVariable("header.X-Apigee-Demo-target", flow.getVariable("target.url"));
print 'Reached the script & assigned header variable' 
```

After invoking the proxy, you'll see that special response header was added:

`X-Apigee-Demo-target: http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w=12797282`


### Set up, deploy, invoke

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies.
