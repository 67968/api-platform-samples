## BaaS application with Node.js on running on Apigee


This cookbook sample illustrates how to create a simple BaaS application with Node.js 
funtioning as the API backend. The application lets you store and retrieve employee
profile information. Apigee App Services provides the cloud-based data storage. 

For overview information and a detailed discussion of this application, see
the Apigee Edge cookbook topic: http://apigee.com/docs


## To set up:

1. You need an account and an organization on Apigee Edge. 
2. Go to the App Services main page, and create a new app called "employees".
3. Create a new user in your org in App Servivces. For the example, this user's ID is "jdoe". 
4. Edit the information in ../../tools/setenv.sh for your local environment. 
5. Edit the file apiproxy/resources/node/config.js. The clientId and clientSecret are 
   listed on the main page for your environment in App Services. 

   exports.organization = 'myorg'
   exports.application = 'employees'
   exports.clientId = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
   exports.clientSecret = 'yyyyyyyyyyyyy'
   exports.username = 'jdoe'
   exports.password = 'Welcome1'
   exports.tokenExpiration = 60000
   exports.logging = true 

 
## To deploy:

    ./deploy.sh

## To run:
