# Catch an error and return a custom error response

This proxy adds **error handling**. If an invalid API key comes in, we'll check for that and return a custom error message. This pattern is one of the most common in Edge proxy development. 


### Provision the required entities

We assume you've provisioned the Product, Developer App, and Developer as explained in proxy-3. If you want to redo it, here's how:

1. `cd api-platform-samples/learn-edge/provisioning`.
2. `./cleanup.sh`.
3. `./setup.sh`.

### Try it

Deploy and invoke the proxy. These are the basic steps:

1. `cd api-platform-samples/tutorials/proxy-4`.
2. `./deploy.sh`
3. `./invoke.sh`
4. Compare the output to the `proxy-4` output. 

### About what changed

* We added our first **FaultRule** to the Proxy Endpoint. You'll see it in `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml`:

    ```xml
    <ProxyEndpoint name="default">
      <FaultRules>
        <FaultRule name="InvalidApiKey">
            <Step>
                <Name>InvalidApiKey</Name>
            </Step>
            <Condition>(fault.name Matches "InvalidApiKey") </Condition>
        </FaultRule>
      </FaultRules>
      ...
    ```

A fault rule is a special kind of flow that executes whenever a policy throws an error. The VerifyApiKey policy can throw errors upon several conditions, like an invalid API key for example. That's exactly what our fault rule is looking for! When the fault rule's condition is true, a policy called InvalidApiKey executes. 

* We added our second **policy** to the proxy. Hint: it is in the `apiproxy/policies` folder and it is called `InvalidApiKey.xml`:

    ```xml
        <AssignMessage async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="InvalidApiKeyMessage">
            <DisplayName>InvalidApiKeyMessage</DisplayName>
            <Properties/>
            <Set>
                <Payload contentType="application/json">\{"error": \{"message":"{fault.name}", "detail":"Please provide valid API key in the apikey query parameter.}} </Payload>
                <StatusCode>400</StatusCode>
                <ReasonPhrase>BadRequest</ReasonPhrase>
            </Set>
            <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
            <AssignTo createNew="false" transport="http" type="response"/>
        </AssignMessage>
    ```


This policy is a little more complicated looking, but it's simple to understand. When called, it sets the response body (payload) to a string value, which is a custom error message. It also sets a status code and reason phrase. This information is what the client app will receive if it sends an invalid API key to Edge, as you saw when you invoked this example.
 

### Important words and concepts

* **Fault rules** Enable you to do error handling within the proxy flow pipline. They are a lot like any flow in the pipeline, but they only execute when an policy throws an error and when the fault rule's condition evaluates to true. 
* **AssignMessage policy** is a policy, not a concept, but remember that it's one of the most commonly used policies in Apigee Edge! It's used to set request and response headers, query parameters, and form parameters, as well as body payloads, and much more. It's kind of a Swiss Army Knife policy -- it does a lot of different things!

### Things to try

* Configure the proxy to return a custom error message when this default error response is thrown:

   ```{"fault":{"faultstring":"Failed to resolve API Key variable request.queryparam.apikey","detail":{"errorcode":"steps.oauth.v2.FailedToResolveAPIKey"}}}
   ```

   Hint: Trap the fault name FailedToResolveAPIKey in another fault rule. How do you cause that error? Try calling the API without the `apikey` query parameter. Like this:  `curl http://<your-org>-test.apigee.net/learn-edge/json`
