# Deploying the sample

The API proxy source code is in the `/apiproxy` directory. Running `deploy.sh` deploys the API proxy from that directory to your Edge environment.

Alternatively, the `helloworld.zip` file is the zipped API proxy bundle that you can upload to your environment using the Edge management UI or API.
