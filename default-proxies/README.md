# Default API proxies

This directory contains the default API proxies that are provided with every 
organization on Apigee Edge. If you create an account on Apigee Edge, and 
then you log in to the Edge management UI, you will see these two API 
proxies in your organization.

We provide them here for convenience. If you need to reset to 'factory settings'
you can simply deploy the API proxies provided here.
