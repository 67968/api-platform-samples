# Apigee API Platform Samples
<<<<<<< HEAD

Welcome to API Platform Samples for the Apigee API Platform
=======
>>>>>>> fa05a8c4c41ac88c2df4a6d925f040761618dee0

Apigee API Platform Samples are designed to help developers 
learn how to use the Apigee API Platform.

Apigee's API Platform provides developers with:

* A RESTful API to enable DIY control and oversight of APIs, 
  apps, and developers 
* API Key and OAuth 1 and 2 support
* Out-of-the-box policies for functionality that you would rather
  not code yourself (like quotas, transformations, response
  caching, etc.)
* APIs and scripting support for functionality that you would 
  rather innovate and code yourself
* The ability to share your work with other developers, and to 
  reuse it across your own projects, by exposing it as
  APIs that you own and control
* Scalable, managed test and prod environments with operational 
  analytics

Fully-featured, free accounts are available at:

These Quick Starts show you how to build API facades that run on the 
API platform, and they include API Keys, OAuth 1 and 2, developer
and app provisioning, custom scripting tutorials, and more.

## /tools

Contains a Python deployment tool (deploy.py) that imports an API proxy to an
organization on the Apigee platform and then deploys it to the environment
specified.

/twitterproxies

A set of proxies that modify the default behavior of the Twitter API:

## /weatherproxies

Fully configured API proxies that can be immediately deployed and
invoked on the API platform, with examples of:

* API key validation
* OAuth 2.0
* Composite services built using policy composition and Javascript, that 
  mashup the Google location and elevation APIs and expose their own 
  API for sharing and reuse.
