# Proxy to a target service

### Try it

Deploy and invoke the proxy. These are the basic steps:

1. `cd api-platform-samples/tutorials/proxy-2`.
2. `./deploy.sh`
3. `./invoke.sh`
4. Compare the output to the `proxy-1` output. 

### About what changed

To get our proxy to call a target service, we made a few changes to the simple do-nothing proxy we deployed before. 

* In the `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml` file, we change the RouteRule from "noroute" to point to the TargetEndpoint called "default". 

   ```xml
   <RouteRule name="default">
        <!-- This connects our proxy to the target defined in apiproxy/targets/default.xml -->
        <TargetEndpoint>default</TargetEndpoint>
   </RouteRule>
   ```

* We add a `default.xml` file in the `apiproxy/targets` directory. In that file, we add this XML block, which specifies the target of the proxy, an HTTP URL:

   ```xml
   <TargetEndpoint name="default">
      <HTTPTargetConnection>
        <!-- This is where we define the target. For this sample we just use a simple URL. -->
        <URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net/</URL>
      </HTTPTargetConnection>
   </TargetEndpoint>
   ```

It points the proxy to a mock service called `http://mocktarget.apigee.net` that Apigee uses for samples and testing.

### Important words and concepts

* The name of the target endpoint can be anything, but it has to match the name of a file in the `targets` directory. ?? Is this true ?? What if the file was called foo.xml ??
* Target service -- A backend service that the proxy calls on behalf of the requesting app. Here, we're going to return data from a service called `mocktarget.apigee.net`. 
* RouteRule -- Specifies which target endpoint definition file to call. Route rules can have logic to route calls conditionally to different targets. 
* TargetEndpoint -- The name of a target definition in the apiproxy/targets directory. 
* HTTPTargetConnection -- Defines the target to which to send the request. Usually a URL. 

### Things to try

* In a browser, hit http://mocktarget.apigee.net/help to see what else the service can do. 
* Modify the `invoke.sh` script to hit one of the other resources. For example: `curl http://<your org>-test.apigee.net/json`. 

**Notable Concept**: By default, whatever you add to the base path of the API proxy gets passed on unchanged to the target. 

* Change the proxy so it calls a different endpoint, maybe a service you are familiar with and test the change (redeploy and invoke). Hint: Edit
