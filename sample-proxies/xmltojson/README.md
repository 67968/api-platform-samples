# XML to JSON Transformation

### Sample use case

Convert an XML-formatted response to JSON. 

### Policies 

This sample uses this policy: 

* ![alt text](../../images/icon-xml-to-json.jpg "XML to JSON policy") XML to JSON: to transform the response from XML to JSON format. 

### About

The sample API proxy calls a backend weather service that returns weather data in XML format by default. We use the XML to JSON policy on the response flow to transform the response to JSON. 

### Set up, deploy, invoke

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies. 

### Result

Weather information for Palo Alto, CA in JSON format. Tip: To get nicely formatted JSON like below, you can try piping the command to a formatting utility. For example: `curl <command> | python -mjson.tool`

```
{
    "rss": {
        "channel": {
            "astronomy": {
                "sunrise": "6:46 am",
                "sunset": "7:23 pm"
            },
            "atmosphere": {

            },
