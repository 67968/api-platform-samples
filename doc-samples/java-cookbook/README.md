# Java Callout Sample

This sample provides a simple implementation of a proxy that uses the JavaCallout policy and
that implements Apigee's JavaCallout Java API.

For a complete description of this proxy sample, see the API Proxy Cookbook topic at:

http://apigee.com/docs/api-platform/content/use-java-customize-api 

Javadoc for the Apigee JavaCallout API Java classes are included in this sample download in:

/api-platform-samples/doc-samples/java-cookbook/javdocs-javacallout

Additional code samples are provided for reference in the '/java/src/com/apigee' directory.
These additional samples demonstrate various blocking and non-blocking patterns you can
use with JavaCallout. They are commented.


This sample proxy uses the Yahoo Weather API for a target endpoint, and maps WEOID IDs to city names on behalf of the user.
