# The simplest proxy

You're going to deploy a simple API proxy on Apigee Edge. Actually, this is the simplest proxy you can make. All it does is return a 200 response to let you know it's working. 

### Try it

All the examples in `learn-edge` work as follows:

1. `cd api-platform-samples/tutorials/proxy-1`.
2. `./deploy.sh` 
    
    It's not important to deconstruct `deploy.sh` now. It just uses a command-line tool to deploy the proxy. 

4. Look at the Edge UI (go to the API Proxies page under the **APIs=>API Proxies** menu) -- you'll see **learn-edge**. 
5. Click **learn-edge**. 
6. Do you see the Overview, Develop, and Trace tabs? Good. Notice in the Overview the Proxy URL is `http://<your org>-test.apigee.net/learn-edge`. This is the URL you will use to call the proxy. 
7. `./invoke.sh`

    This script executes a curl command:

    `curl http://<your org>-test.apigee.net`

Did you get back a Status 200. Great! 

### What you did

You deployed a basic proxy to Edge, called it, and got a 200 response.

### Important words and concepts

* This is the basic file structure for all Edge API proxies. As we'll see in starting with proxy-2, these directories will contain XML files that define how the proxy works. 

```
/apiproxy
   /proxies
   /targets
   /policies
   /resources
   proxyname.xml
```

* This structure is mapped into the Edge UI, although the UI uses slightly different names for the components.

* Many developers develop proxies locally and deploy them using a command line tool (like the one used in the `./invoke.sh` file) or tools like Maven and Grunt. It's all about properly packaging and uploading the local files to Edge.
