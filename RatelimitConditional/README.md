The client IP is checked for each request--------------------------Pre-Conditions--------------------------1. Identify server name/IP Address and port of the Apigee Gateway installation.2. Identify the credentials for the Apigee Gateway installation.3. Identify the organization, environment and virtual host name and port for your instance.You can get this information from person who setup the Apigee installation.4.

To test the deployed sample execute the below curl command, http://<VH host alias:pot>/devices2http://<virtualhost:port>/4g-samples-ratelimitconditional - this wont give an error for any number of requestshttp://<virtualhost:port>/4g-samples-ratelimitconditional/?lang=fil - this would give a quota validation after 2 requests from one IP.sample error message:{"fault":{"faultstring":"policies.ratelimit.QuotaViolation","detail":{"errorcode":"policies.ratelimit.QuotaViolation"}}}In this sample ratelimit is enforced for 2 requests per minute. If you send a request after one min, valid response should be shown.--------------------------Clean up--------------------------Execute "sh cleanup.sh"
