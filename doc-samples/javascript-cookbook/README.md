# Simple JavaScript Sample

This sample demonstrates how to write, attach, and execute simple JavaScript in
an API proxy flow. 

The sample implements the cookbook topic:

[JavaScript Proxy Cookbook Topic](http://apigee.com/docs/api-platform/content/use-javascript-customize-api)

The JavaScript in this sample gets a variable from the flow and sets the variable 
as HTTP headers on the response message.

It also demonstrates how you can work with message content. A policy is used to 
transform the weather report from XML to JSON. The resultant JSON is then parsed
into a minimized response message that would mobile device-friendly.

# Configuration

Note that JavaScripts are stored under /resources/jsc in the API proxy, and then 
referenced by policies of type Javascript. (Note capitalization of 'Javascript' in 
policy type.)

The JavaScript policies are then attached to ProxyEndpoint Flow to execute the 
JavaScripts in the appropriate sequence.
