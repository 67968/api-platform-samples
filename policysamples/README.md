Welcome to API Platform Samples for the Apigee API Platform

Apigee API Platform Samples are designed to help you, the app and
API developer, learn how to use the Apigee API Platform.

Apigee's API Platform provides developers with:

- A RESTful API to enable DIY control and oversight of APIs, 
  apps, and developers 
- API Key and OAuth 1 and 2 support
- Out-of-the-box policies for functionality that you would rather
  not code yourself (like quotas, transformations, response
  caching, etc)
- APIs and scripting support for functionality that you WOULD 
  rather innovate and code yourself
- The ability to share your work with other developers, and to 
  reuse it across your own projects, by exposing it as
  APIs that you own and control
- Scalable, managed test and prod environments with operational 
  analytics to help you keep your code solid and your app 
  end users happy

What's here:

/simpleProxy

A basic API proxy that is used in the API Platform Quick Starts at:
http://apigee.com/docs/api/quick-starts-index/
These Quick Starts show you how to build API facades that run on the 
API platform, and they include API Keys, OAuth 1 and 2, developer
and app provisioning, custom scripting tutorials, and more.

/tools

Contains a deployment tool (deploy.py) that imports an API proxy to an
organization on the Apigee platform and then deploys it to the environment
specified.

/mobile-friendly-twitter

Optimize Twitter activity streams for resource-constrained mobile devices.

/twitter-oembed

Implement Twitter oembed, while supporting CORS

/twitter-translate

Call out to a third-party translation API to localize Tweets in real time.

/weatherproxies

Fully configured API proxies that can be immediately deployed and
invoked on the API platform, with examples of:

* API key validation
* OAuth 2.0
* Composite services built using policy composition and Javascript, that 
  mashup the Google location and elevation APIs and expose their own 
  API for sharing and reuse.
