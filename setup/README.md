# Apigee Platform API Samples Setup

This directory provides scripts that configure your local environment and deploy sample API proxies to your organization on the Apigee API Platform.

# Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed and added as environment variables (recognizable when you run, for example, <code>which curl</code>)

* cURL
* Python

## Windows with Cygwin
If you're running Cygwin on Windows, you'll also need the doc2unix utility. You can install this with the Cygwin installer.


# Directions

1. If you do not have an account yet, [register one for free](https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up).

2. In the file `setenv.sh`, configure values for your organization, username, environment.

3. Deploy the samples.

    * To deploy individual samples, run `deploy.sh` from the `./setup` directory.
Follow prompts.
	* To deploy all samples, run `deploy_all.sh` from the `./setup` directory. 
Follow prompts.

4. Navigate to the sample-proxies directory. Each sample API proxy directory contains an invoke.sh file. Run invoke.sh to submit a request to that sample API proxy.

## Windows/Cygwin Troubleshooting

If you get an error saying <code>'\r': command not found</code>, you'll need to run the dos2unix utility to convert line breaks in the shell (.sh) files. You may need to install the utility if the <code>which dos2unix</code> can't find it. The Cygwin installer should let you install it.

To run dos2unix:

1. cd to the api-platform-samples directory.

2. Run the following command:
    find . -name *.sh |xargs dos2unix

3. If the command runs successfully, you can re-run ./deploy_all.sh.
