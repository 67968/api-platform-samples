### Sample use case

Extract data into flow variables from the response message. Assign extracted variables to HTTP response headers. 

### Trace

This screen shot from the [Apigee Edge trace tool](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/content/using-trace-tool-0) shows the placement of the policies used in this sample.

### About

The target API is a service that returns weather data. We attach policies to the response flow to demonstrate how to extract and assign variables:

1. Extract variables from the XML response sent from the target. We use XPath syntax to identify the data to extract. The extracted data includes weather location, condition, today's forecast, and tomorrow's forecast. 
2. Convert the response payload from XML to JSON.
3. Extract more variables from the converted JSON payload. We use JSONPath syntax to identify the data to extract. The extracted data includes the weather description and humidity. 
4. Assign the extracted variables to HTTP response headers. 

### Set up, deploy, invoke

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies.
