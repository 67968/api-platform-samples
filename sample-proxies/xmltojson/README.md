![alt text](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/blob/master/images/icon-xml-to-json.jpg)

### Sample use case

Convert an XML-formatted response to JSON. 

### About

The sample API proxy calls a backend weather service that returns weather data in JSON format by default. We use the XML to JSON policy to transform the response to XML. 

### Set up, deploy, invoke

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies.
