# Apigee API Platform Samples

Welcome to API Platform Samples for the Apigee API Platform
=======

Apigee API Platform Samples are designed to help developers 
learn how to use the Apigee API Platform.

Apigee's API Platform provides developers with:

* A RESTful API to enable DIY control and oversight of APIs, 
  apps, and developers 
* API Key and OAuth 1 and 2 support
* Out-of-the-box policies for functionality that you would rather
  not code yourself (like quotas, transformations, response
  caching, etc.)
* APIs and scripting support for functionality that you would 
  rather innovate and code yourself
* The ability to share your work with other developers, and to 
  reuse it across your own projects, by exposing it as
  APIs that you own and control
* Scalable, managed test and prod environments with operational 
  analytics
