# Pagination sample

This sample demonstrates how you can add pagination to the 
response returned by a backend service.

This is beneficial because it means that you don't need to do 
pagination of the results in the app running on a mobile device.

It also means that you don't need to implement pagination in your
backend service.

This sample uses XSLT to transform a cached XML response to return 
a result set based on two parameters presented by the app: 
'limit' and 'offset'.
