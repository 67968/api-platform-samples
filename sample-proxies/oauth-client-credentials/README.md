# Client credentials grant type

This sample demonstrates the client credentials grant type where Apigee Edge is the OAuth 2.0 authorization server. 

## About client credentials

Most typically, this grant type is used when the app is also the resource owner. For example, an app may need to access a backend cloud-based storage service to store and retrieve data that it uses to perform its work, rather than data specifically owned by the end user. This grant type flow occurs strictly between a client app and the authorization server. An end user does not participate in this grant type flow. 

## How it works

With the client credentials grant type flow, the client app requests an access token directly by providing its client ID and client secret keys. These keys are generated when the app is registered with Apigee Edge. 

## How is it designed? 

The client credentials sample uses one policy: An OAuthV2 policy to generate the access token. The policy is attached to the `/accesstoken` endpoint (a custom flow on Apigee Edge). 

## Prerequisites

To run this sample, you'll need:

* The username and password that you use to login to `enterprise.apigee.com`.

* The name of the organization in which you have an account. Login to 
  `enterprise.apigee.com` and check account settings.

## Configure 

Edit and run these scripts to provision required entities on Apigee Edge:

1. Update `/setup/setenv.sh` with your environment details.

2. Configure API products, developers, and apps in your organization.

3. Run `/setup/provisioning/setup.sh`

## Deploy and run the sample project

To deploy, run `$ sh deploy.sh`

To test, run `$ sh invoke.sh`

## Result

The `invoke.sh` script builds and executes the curl command shown below. The command calls the access token endpoint on Apigee Edge with the URL encoded client ID and client secret keys sent in the Authorization header.
