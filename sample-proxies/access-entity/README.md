### Sample use case

Retrieve profiles for Apigee Edge entities. Entities include such things as developers, developer apps, products, and more. 

### Trace

This screen shot from the [Apigee Edge trace tool](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/content/using-trace-tool-0) shows the placement of the policies used in this sample.

### About

This sample shows how to retrieve profiles for entities from the Apigee Edge
datastore. Using this policy, you can retrieve profiles for things like
apps, developers, and API products. Sometimes you need this information 
to enable dynamic behavior in policies or code running on Apigee Edge.

This example shows you how to get a developer's email address based on 
an API key. This works because an API key can be used to uniquely identify a developer associated with a developer app. 

In this sample, we use the `invoke.sh` to call the API with a valid API key. 

### Quick task before you run the sample

You need to grab a valid API key from your Apigee Edge org and add it to the `invoke.sh` file. 

1. Log in to the Edge UI.
2. Select Developer Apps from the Publish menu. 
3. Select any developer app -- it doesn't matter which one, as long as it has a Consumer Key that you can copy. 
4. Click Show next to the Consumer Key for a product. 
5. Copy the Consumer Key. 
6. Open `invoke.sh` and insert the key you copied into the `KEY` variable:

    `KEY="t3AyRHIfbNJwJ6ZbBAxGmNj5YWljAeB"`

7. Save the file. 

### Set up, deploy, invoke

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies. 

### Result

When you invoke this proxy, it returns an HTTP response to your terminal, shown below. Note that the response includes a custom header `X-Developer-email`. The value of this header was extracted and set dynamically on Edge. The actual email address depends on the API key you used to call the API. 

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    User-Agent: curl/7.37.1
    Host: docs-test.apigee.net
    Accept: */*
    X-Developer-email: tesla@weathersample.com
    Content-Length: 0
    Connection: keep-alive
    ```
