# The order in which fault rules execute

In this sample, we illustrate that fault rules have a specific order in which they execute. TL;DR: The last fault rule that evaluates to TRUE in a chain of rules is the one that executes.


### Provision the required entities

We assume you've provisioned the Product, Developer App, and Developer as explained in `apikey-security`. If you want to redo it, here's how:

1. `cd api-platform-samples/learn-edge/provisioning`.
2. `./cleanup.sh`.
3. `./setup.sh`.

### Try it

Deploy and invoke the proxy. These are the basic steps:

1. `cd api-platform-samples/learn-edge/fault-handling-intro`.
2. `./deploy.sh`
3. `./invoke.sh`
4. See which error message is returned for each query parameter value. Hint: The winner is the LAST Fault Rule that evalulates to true, in the order in which the rules appear in the XML.

### View it in the Edge UI

Go to the Edge UI and run a Trace on this API. How does it differ from the Trace you saw in `apikey-security`? You can see where the fault occurs and where control shifts to the error flow. 

### About what changed

* We added three Fault Rules to the Proxy Endpoint. They check the truth value of a query parameter. You'll see it in `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml`:

    ```xml
        ...
        <FaultRules>
        <FaultRule name="InvalidApiKey">
            <Step>
                <Name>InvalidApiKeyMessage</Name>
            </Step>
            <Condition>(fault.name Matches "InvalidApiKey") </Condition>
        </FaultRule>
        <FaultRule name="BadParam-A">
            <Step>
                <Name>CatchBadParam-A</Name>
            </Step>
            <Condition>(request.queryparam.bad-param-A Matches "true") </Condition>
        </FaultRule>
        <FaultRule name="BadParam-B">
            <Step>
                <Name>CatchBadParam-B</Name>
            </Step>
            <Condition>(request.queryparam.bad-param-B Matches "true") </Condition>
        </FaultRule>
         <FaultRule name="BadParam-C">
            <Step>
                <Name>CatchBadParam-C</Name>
            </Step>
            <Condition>(request.queryparam.bad-param-C Matches "true") </Condition>
        </FaultRule>
      </FaultRules>
      ...
    ```

When an invalid key is sent, the proxy goes into the Error Flow and the Fault Rules are evaluated. The LAST Fault Rule that evaluates to TRUE executes. 

* We added an **Assign Message policy** for each of the fault conditions -- they just return a message to tell the user which Fault Rule exectued. Hint: they are in the `apiproxy/policies` folder and are called `CatchBadParam-A.xml`, `CatchBadParam-B.xml`, `CatchBadParam-C.xml`:
 

### Extra reading: important terms and concepts

* **Fault rules: order of execution** When the proxy goes into the Error Flow, the Fault Rules are evaluated. The LAST Fault Rule that evaluates to TRUE executes. 


### Next step

The next proxy, [response-cache-1](../response-cache-1/README.md), illustrates you can have multiple fault rules in a proxy and the order in which fault rules execute.
