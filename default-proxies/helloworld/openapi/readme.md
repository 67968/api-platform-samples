# OpenAPI spec for the helloworld sample

`helloworld.yaml` is an [OpenAPI specification](https://openapis.org/) for Apigee's `helloworld` RESTful target service, located at http://mocktarget.apigee.net (more information about the service [here](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/default-proxies/helloworld)).

With `helloworld.yaml`, you can generate interactive SmartDocs API documentation for the helloworld service in your Edge developer portal just like you would any OpenAPI spec you created yourself. In fact, we used `helloworld.yaml` to generate SmartDocs on the [Apigee documentation site](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/hello-world-sample-proxy-api) for you to try out.

For more information on how to generate SmartDocs with an OpenAPI spec, see [Using SmartDocs to document APIs](http://docs.apigee.com/developer-services/content/using-smartdocs-document-apis) in the Apigee docs.
