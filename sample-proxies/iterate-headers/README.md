# Iterate through httpClient() response headers

This proxy demonstrates how to iterate through the list of response headers returned from an httpClient() call. The httpClient function lets you make HTTP API calls from within a JavaScript policy. 

The JavaScript code iterates through the response headers and concatenates them into a string, with a little extra formatting for clarity. 

## Example

```
**API request:**

curl http://willwitman-test.apigee.net/iterate-headers

**API response:**

Access-Control-Allow-Origin --> *
Connection --> keep-alive
Content-Length --> 68
Content-Type --> application/json; charset=utf-8
Date --> Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:16:42 GMT
ETag --> W/"44-rA5eRt/mMLik54NvbWbSzg"
X-Powered-By --> Apigee
```
