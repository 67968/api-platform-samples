# Apigee API Platform Samples

Apigee API Platform Samples are designed to help developers 
learn how to use the Apigee API Platform.

Apigee's API Platform provides developers with:

* A RESTful API to enable DIY control and oversight of APIs, 
  apps, and developers 
* API Key and OAuth 1 and 2 support
* Out-of-the-box policies for functionality that you would rather
  not code yourself (like quotas, transformations, response
  caching, etc.)
* APIs and scripting support for functionality that you would 
  rather innovate and code yourself
* The ability to share your work with other developers, and to 
  reuse it across your own projects, by exposing it as
  APIs that you own and control
* Scalable, managed test and prod environments with operational 
  analytics

# Getting started

## Contents

# What's here:

/sample-proxies

A set of fully-functional API proxies that you can deploy and invoke
on the Apigee API Platform.

/schemas

XML schemas that you can  use as a reference when working with policies, API proxy configuration,
API products, apps, and developers.

/setup

Simple scripts to help you deploy the sample API proxies and profiles that they 
rely on, including API products, developers, and apps.

/simpleProxy

A basic API proxy that is used in the API Platform Quick Starts at:

http://apigee.com/docs/api/quick-starts-index

These quick starts show you how to build API facades that run on the 
API platform, and they include API Keys, OAuth 1 and 2, developer
and app provisioning, custom scripting tutorials, and more.

/tools

Contains a Python deployment tool (deploy.py) that imports an API proxy to an
organization on the Apigee platform and then deploys it to the environment
specified.
